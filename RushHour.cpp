@brief This program will solve a traffic jam. The result will be the
solution with the smallest number of moves.
@details This is the class implementation of the board and the cars that
interact with it.

/**
@mainpage
This short program contains a recursive solution to solving a game of Rush Hour
in the least possible amount of moves using breadth-first search.

The Board class manages all of the Vehicle objects within it, which does so by
modifying an array and moving the car around by changing their row and column
positions. The Vehicles inside of the Board class act as a Linked List, and
whenever a function such as <em>moveForward()</em> is called, it will perform the
method on the car that the cursor pointer is pointing to.
